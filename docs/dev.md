# Perses Operator

An operator to install [Perses](https://github.com/perses/perses) in a k8s cluster.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need:

- a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) or [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) installed and configured to use your cluster.

### Running on the cluster

1. Install custom resource definitions:
```sh
make install
```

2. Create a namespace for the resources:
```sh
kubectl create namespace perses-dev
```

3. Install custom resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples
```

4. Using the the location specified by `IMG`, build a testing image and push it to the registry, then deploy the controller to the cluster:
> **Note:** Make sure the image is accessible either publicly or from the cluster internal registry.

```sh
IMG=<some-registry>/perses-operator:tag make test-image-build image-push deploy
```

> **Note:** If you already have an image built, you can deploy it to the cluster using `IMG=<some-registry>/perses-operator:tag make deploy`.

5. Port forward the service so you can access the Perses UI at `http://localhost:8080`:

```sh
kubectl -n perses-dev port-forward svc/perses-sample 8080:8080
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

Each instance of the CRD deploys the following resources:

- A ConfigMap holding the perses configuration
- A Service so perses API can be accessed from within the cluster
- A Deployment holding the perses API

### Test It Out

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources and run the controller:

```sh
PERSES_IMAGE=docker.io/persesdev/perses:v0.50.3 make install run
```

2. Install a CRD instance

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/v1alpha1_perses.yaml
```

3. Uninstall the CRD instance

```sh
kubectl delete -f config/samples/v1alpha1_perses.yaml
```

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests # Generate YAML manifests like CRDs, RBAC etc.
make generate # Generate code containing DeepCopy, DeepCopyInto, and DeepCopyObject method implementations.
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

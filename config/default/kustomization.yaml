# [CERTMANAGER] To enable cert-manager, uncomment all sections with 'CERTMANAGER'.
# Uncomment 'CERTMANAGER' sections in crd/kustomization.yaml to enable the CA injection in the admission webhooks.
# 'CERTMANAGER' needs to be enabled to use ca injection
# Note: webhookcainjection_patch.yaml is not needed since this operator only has conversion webhooks, not admission webhooks

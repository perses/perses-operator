                                DurationString is a string that represents a duration, such as "1h", "30m", "15s", etc.
                                It is used to unmarshal a duration string from JSON or YAML, and validate that it is a valid duration string.

                                Not converting the duration string into a time.Duration type allows us to avoid the issue of changing the initial input with an alias.
                                This is something that happens when we use Duration type, because when the duration is unmarshalled then marshaled again, the input can be changed with an equivalent duration.
                                For example "14d" will be changed to "2w".

                                So, use DurationString instead of Duration when you want to preserve the original input string.
                                If, for any reason, you need to convert the DurationString to a time.Duration, you can use the ParseDuration function.

                                DurationString is a string that represents a duration, such as "1h", "30m", "15s", etc.
                                It is used to unmarshal a duration string from JSON or YAML, and validate that it is a valid duration string.

                                Not converting the duration string into a time.Duration type allows us to avoid the issue of changing the initial input with an alias.
                                This is something that happens when we use Duration type, because when the duration is unmarshalled then marshaled again, the input can be changed with an equivalent duration.
                                For example "14d" will be changed to "2w".

                                So, use DurationString instead of Duration when you want to preserve the original input string.
                                If, for any reason, you need to convert the DurationString to a time.Duration, you can use the ParseDuration function.

                      seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                      It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                      Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                      "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                      This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                      "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                      This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                      It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                      Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                      whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                      CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                      "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                      and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                      This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                      All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                          core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                          When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                          the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic

                          if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                          compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                          both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                          value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                          When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                          dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                            specified.
                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                            in any namespaces.
                          (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                          (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                      description: |-
                        ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                        The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                        and deleted when the pod is removed.

                        Use this if:
                        a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                        b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                           tracking are needed,
                        c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                        d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                           information on the connection between this volume type
                           and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                        APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                        of an individual pod.

                        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                        be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                        more information.

                        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                        persistent volumes at the same time.
                      properties:
                        volumeClaimTemplate:
                          description: |-
                            Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                            The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                            owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                            pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                            `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                            entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                            is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                            will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                            meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                            owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                            this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                            manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                            This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes
                            to the PVC after it has been created.

                                    volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                    core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                    When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                    the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                    provisioner.
                                    This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                    if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                    compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                    both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                    value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                    When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                    dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                      specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                      in any namespaces.
                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                    (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                        image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                        The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                        - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                        - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                        - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                        The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                        A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                        The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                        The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                        The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                        Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                        The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                            Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                            IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                            Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                            Pull secrets will be assembled in the same way as for the container image by looking up node credentials, SA image pull secrets, and pod spec image pull secrets.

                                  ClusterTrustBundle allows a pod to access the `.spec.trustBundle` field
                                  of ClusterTrustBundle objects in an auto-updating file.

                                  Alpha, gated by the ClusterTrustBundleProjection feature gate.

                                  ClusterTrustBundle objects can either be selected by name, or by the
                                  combination of signer name and a label selector.

                                  Kubelet performs aggressive normalization of the PEM contents written
                                  into the pod filesystem.  Esoteric PEM features such as inter-block
                                  comments and block headers are stripped.  Certificates are deduplicated.
                                  The ordering of certificates within the file is arbitrary, and Kubelet
                                  may change the order over time.

                                  Projects an auto-rotating credential bundle (private key and certificate
                                  chain) that the pod can use either as a TLS client or server.

                                  Kubelet generates a private key and uses it to send a
                                  PodCertificateRequest to the named signer.  Once the signer approves the
                                  request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and
                                  certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod does not start until
                                  certificates have been issued for each podCertificate projected volume
                                  source in its spec.

                                  Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated
                                  by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt
                                  timestamp.

                                  Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath
                                  field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and
                                  certificateChainPath fields.

                                  The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM
                                  entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM
                                  entries are the certificate chain issued by the signer (typically,
                                  signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).

                                  Prefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code
                                  can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and certificateChainPath,
                                  your application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide
                                  with a certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf
                                  certificate you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application
                                  will need to check for this condition, and re-read until they are
                                  consistent.

                                  The named signer controls chooses the format of the certificate it
                                  issues; consult the signer implementation's documentation to learn how to
                                  use the certificates it issues.

                                      Most applications should use credentialBundlePath.  When using keyPath
                                      and certificateChainPath, your application needs to check that the key
                                      and leaf certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the
                                      files mid-rotation.

                                      Write the credential bundle at this path in the projected volume.

                                      The credential bundle is a single file that contains multiple PEM blocks.
                                      The first PEM block is a PRIVATE KEY block, containing a PKCS#8 private
                                      key.

                                      The remaining blocks are CERTIFICATE blocks, containing the issued
                                      certificate chain from the signer (leaf and any intermediates).

                                      Using credentialBundlePath lets your Pod's application code make a single
                                      atomic read that retrieves a consistent key and certificate chain.  If you
                                      project them to separate files, your application code will need to
                                      additionally check that the leaf certificate was issued to the key.

                                      Kubelet copies this value verbatim into the PodCertificateRequests it
                                      generates for this projection.

                                      If omitted, kube-apiserver will set it to 86400(24 hours). kube-apiserver
                                      will reject values shorter than 3600 (1 hour).  The maximum allowable
                                      value is 7862400 (91 days).

                                      The signer implementation is then free to issue a certificate with any
                                      lifetime *shorter* than MaxExpirationSeconds, but no shorter than 3600
                                      seconds (1 hour).  This constraint is enforced by kube-apiserver.
                                      `kubernetes.io` signers will never issue certificates with a lifetime
                                      longer than 24 hours.

                                      userAnnotations allow pod authors to pass additional information to

                                      metadata in any way.

                                      These values are copied verbatim into the `spec.unverifiedUserAnnotations` field of
